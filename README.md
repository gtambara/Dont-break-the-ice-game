A simple console C "Battleship" like game, based on the famous "Don't break the ice" toy and the "The legend of Aang" cartoon, that made when learning about matrices in my first semester at the University of Brasília in the course of "Algoritmos e programação de computadores" in 2018/1.

To play, you just have to find a friend and both have to choose their names. Then, when a player enters his round, he's able to select the x and y coordinates and break the ice located there. They can try to break more than one ice per round, but there is a chance none is broken.
The objective is to collect the greater number of points(aquired when you break an ice block) before Aang(represented by the blocks of 'U') sinks by completly disconnecting from the ice

PS: the game is in brazilian portuguese.
